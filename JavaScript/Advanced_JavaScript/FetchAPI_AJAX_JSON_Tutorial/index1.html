    <!--
        API - Application Programming interface
        The fetch API provides an interface for fetching data from backend means server. It uses request or response objects.
        The fetch() method is used to fetch data from backend means server. It uses request and response objects.
        We request any API to give some data and it returns data in the form of response.
        fetch() returns first promise

        let promise=fetch(url,[options]);
        when we don't specify options then it will give get request means the request which is used to get some data from API

        status:200 means successful request means data got successfully
        when we use promise that time there are multiple ways to return result from promises.
        1) promise chaining: .then, .catch
        2) using asynchronous function: async, await

        By using API only we can get data without reloading the page



        AJAX - Asynchronous JS & XML (Nowadays AJAX means API calls)
        JSON - JavaScript Object Notation (Nowadays data are sent in JSON format)
        json() method is asynchronous method which returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON. (Input is JSON, output is JS object)

        Process of API call
        1) requesting API to fetch some data
        2) it returns response in the JSON format
        3) converting JSON format to JS object using json() method
